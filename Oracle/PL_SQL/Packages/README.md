Everyone should have their own dedicateed utility packages when creating a PL/SQL codebase (or a good codebase in general).\
Utility Packages that I think all PL/SQL codebases should have (and codebases in general)
- String Utils
- Date Utils
- Global Constants
- Asserts
- Debug
- Error
- String Builder (SQL Builder)
- CRUD Operations (and derivatives)
    - In PL/SQL, running generic sql statements against tables for example
