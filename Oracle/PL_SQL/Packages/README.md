For future reference, I believe everyone should have their own utility packages when creating a PL/SQL codebase.\
Utility Packages that I think all PL/SQL codebases should have (and codebases in general)
- String Utils
- Date Utils
- Global Constants
- Asserts
- Debug
- Error
- String Builder (SQL Builder)
